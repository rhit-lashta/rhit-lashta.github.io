        <h4>Description<h4>
        <div class="portfolioText">
            <p>This was a project developed in my CSSE-220 class at Rose-Hulman and it was a group project between 2 other partners. It took place over 3 weeks and we had the choice to make one of two different types of game in Eclipse. We chose the harder of the two which was to make a clone of the game Celeste. The game was programmed using Java primarily focusing on parent classes and  inheritance to get the game to run.</p>
