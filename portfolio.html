        <p> Developed in <a href="https://github.com/rhit-csse220/csse220-fall-2024-2025-final-project-f24_a301#">Eclipse</a></p>
        <h4>Description<h4>
        <p>This was a project developed in my CSSE-220 class at Rose-Hulman and it was a group project between 2 other partners. It took place over 3 weeks and we had the choice to make one of two different types of game in Eclipse. We chose the harder of the two which was to make a clone of the game Celeste. The game was programmed using Java primarily focusing on parent classes and inheritance to get the game to run.</p>
